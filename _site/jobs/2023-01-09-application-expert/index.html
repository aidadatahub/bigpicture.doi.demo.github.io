<p>Linköping University hereby advertises a position as
Research engineer - Application expert in Medical imaging diagnostics AI at the AIDA Data Hub,
belonging to the Department of Science and Technology,
based at the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Linköping University Hospital.</p>

<p>The AIDA Data Hub <a href="#research-context">research context</a> within CMIV, AIDA, RÖ, SciLifeLab, NBIS, BIIF, DDLS, ELIXIR, and Bigpicture is described separately below.</p>

<h3 id="topic-for-the-position">Topic for the position</h3>

<p>The Analytic Imaging Diagnostics Arena (<a href="https://medtech4health.se/aida">AIDA</a>)
facilitates collaboration between national stakeholders in medical imaging
diagnostics AI, to accelerate development and use of world leading AI tools.
This requires advanced analyses and training of AI algorithms based on massive
amounts of medical images and clinical data. The
<a href="https://datahub.aida.scilifelab.se">AIDA Data Hub</a> provides services and policy
support to the AIDA arena, to increase availability of data for ethical and
legal research, and also provides resources for secure processing and sharing of
massive amounts of sensitive personal medical imaging data for research.</p>

<p>The AIDA Data Hub is now planning to extend its service portfolio with
application expertise in medical imaging diagnostics AI, to provide advanced
support and training to researchers in the AIDA community. The primary focus is
on projects with a clear connection to the broader SciLifeLab and DDLS aims,
including precision medicine and multi-omics.</p>

<h3 id="duties">Duties</h3>
<p>The application expert will establish a new function for advanced support and
training at AIDA Data Hub. The function is to be based on needs identified
through active use case driven collaboration with researchers and innovators in
AIDA, and in interaction with established functions for advanced support and
training at SciLifeLab, NBIS, and BIIF. The application expert will be central
for ensuring constructive operational day-to-day collaboration between these
organizations and strengthen bidirectional knowledge sharing among these
organizations and their respective user communities.</p>

<p>In operation and continuous development of the new support function, the
application expert will work integrated in national research and innovation
projects, and take on research and AI development tasks in medical imaging
diagnostics, precision medicine, and multi-omics. This will often entail working
with sensitive personal medical imaging data on privacy-preserving data
platforms. This will require addressing challenges of many types, primarily
technical, but also legal questions and integrity considerations. A key duty is
to develop a keen understanding of challenges and opportunities that leading
research users face, and to clearly communicate these findings so that the data
platform development efforts can be directed to where they can add the most
value. It will therefore be very important to maintain close collaboration also
with the sensitive data service development teams, primarily at the AIDA Data
Hub and NBIS Systems development units, but also at the Finnish ELIXIR node and
other international sites.</p>

<h3 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h3>
<p>The position requires a Ph d degree and a scientific track record in a relevant
field, or comparable experience from academia, industry or healthcare. The
position also requires having a collaborative spirit, an inquisitive mind, and a
passion for finding ways to support research excellence. Leadership skills and
self-management ability are success factors for this position, and demonstrating
experience of independence and drive in professional initiatives will be given
weight when evaluating candidates.</p>

<p>Experience from research in a data-intensive computer science domain is
considered a strong merit, in particular work with AI development and
large-scale medical imaging data. Experience from management of integrity
aspects of personal data is a valued qualification for this position, in
particular experience from designing or using data platforms in secured or
air-gapped environments. Experience from cross-functional and distributed work
is also considered a merit, with most weight given to experience from
international research collaborations.</p>

<p>The position requires excellent communication abilities, both spoken and
written, in the English language. Such abilities also in the Swedish language
are considered a very strong merit.</p>

<p>A background check and security evaluation will be conducted.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-candidates-senior-experts-at-data-science-excellence-center-in-medical-imaging">Call for candidates: Senior experts at data science excellence center in medical imaging</h2>

<p>At the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization
(<a href="https://liu.se/cmiv">CMIV</a>), Linköping University, Sweden, there are several
ground-breaking initiatives to support data-driven research on large-scale data
from clinical sources.</p>

<p>The operations are ramping up within existing commitments, and there are
imminent opportunities to expand both size and scope dramatically. To drive this
development, we will need additions to the leadership of the data science
management team in the form of senior experts on IT architecture, data
protection and other data science operations.</p>

<p>In essence, the objective is to enable science advances for the benefit of
future healthcare, based on AI training and other data-driven research. Our
efforts target the key issue of providing access to vast amounts of realistic
data from healthcare. This entails a number of challenges, not the least to
preserve the integrity when handling sensitive personal data.</p>

<p>The ongoing initiatives and future plans are further described below.</p>

<h3 id="competences-needed">Competences needed</h3>

<p>There are interesting multi-faceted challenges to address, mapping to a spectrum
of technical competences which we believe a combination of two additional
experts is suitable for, in addition to our current team.</p>

<ul>
  <li>IT architecture for data sharing platforms</li>
  <li>Design and development of shared compute systems for AI</li>
  <li>Data protection expertise - technical, organizational &amp; legal</li>
  <li>Development of educational programs for data science researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>To a large extent, the technical building blocks needed are available. These
roles are expected to - using a deep technical understanding - address the
strategic design challenges regarding technical systems, organizations, and
workflows, to set a new standard for use of medical data in computer science
research.</p>

<p>At a personal level, candidates for these positions are required to have high
social competence and a pragmatic mindset. They must have an ability to deal
with highly complex problems and a wide range of tasks. A can-do attitude is
important, as well as an enthusiasm for quickly learning.</p>

<h3 id="aida-data-hub">AIDA Data Hub</h3>

<p><a href="/" title="AIDA Data Hub"><img src="/assets/images/aida-banner-7-4.jpg" width="30%" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>One of the platforms operated out of CMIV is the <a href="/">AIDA Data Hub</a>. We offer
data sharing, policy support, and services for researchers in Swedish medical
imaging AI, and operate the currently largest national AI research system for
sensitive personal data in Sweden.  AIDA Data Hub is part of the Analytic
Imaging Diagnostics Arena (AIDA), and of the SciLifeLab Bioinformatics Platform
(NBIS) and its BioImage Informatics facility (BIIF). The senior experts to be
recruited would be involved in operating and developing the AIDA Data Hub
together with the AIDA Data Director, leading a team of junior engineers.</p>

<p>Assignments could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advising on information security practices and legal interpretations to Swedish parties involved in research and innovation from academia, healthcare and industry</li>
  <li>Sharing of sensitive personal data and anonymous data for research
    <ul>
      <li>System development and administration for the sharing platform</li>
      <li>Ensuring interoperability with related systems external to the platform</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Running a national compute service secure enough for sensitive personal data
    <ul>
      <li>Offering easy-to-use and isolated compute access (Linux management, KVM, NFS)</li>
      <li>Operating and developing information security (firewalls, network configuration, authentication, etc)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Leading junior engineers on running less critical systems (NextCloud, PACS, Wiki, GitHub, Slack, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bigpicture">BIGPICTURE</h3>

<p><a href="https://bigpicture.eu" title="BIGPICTURE: A central repository for European digital pathology AI"><img src="/assets/images/bigpicture-4-3.png" width="30%" class="right" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://bigpicture.eu">BIGPICTURE</a> is a 70 MEUR EU project in the Innovative
Medicine Initiative program. Starting in 2021, the mission is to build a
multi-petabyte platform for digital pathology data to be used for AI training.
CMIV is responsible for the infrastructure development, in close collaboration
with Uppsala University (NBIS/SciLifeLab) and CSC in Finland.</p>

<p>The senior experts to be recruited would be involved in operating and developing
the BIGPICTURE platform.</p>

<p>Assignments could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advising on information security practices and legal interpretations, from a Swedish perspective in a European collaboration, to parties involved in research and innovation from academia, healthcare and industry</li>
  <li>Designing and developing backend for a sharing platform for sensitive personal data and anonymous data for research
    <ul>
      <li>Leading and performing devops for the sharing platform as part of a local+distributed Scrum team</li>
      <li>Interaction with stakeholders such as data owners (healthcare, pharma companies) and data users (AI researchers)</li>
      <li>Ensuring interoperability with related systems external to the platform</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Advising on platform strategy, from a variety of technical and business perspectives</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cmiv-data-services">CMIV Data services</h3>

<p><a href="/" title="CMIV: Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization"><img src="/assets/images/cmiv-banner-7-4.jpg" width="30%" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>In addition to, and in close interplay with, the running initiatives above, CMIV
is creating the next generation of data services for research on medical imaging
data. The envisioned data lakes will dramatically increase the access to
relevant healthcare data for research purposes and the efforts are mirrored by
Region Östergötland. This development is highly in line with LiU top priorities
and is run in tight conncetion with LiU initiatives towards hosting large-scale
computing for sensitive personal data, both locally and nationally.</p>

<p>The senior experts to be recruited will have key roles in designing, developing
and operating the next generation of data services, employing skill sets similar
to those outlined for the AIDA Data Hub and BIGPICTURE.</p>

<h3 id="contact">Contact</h3>

<p>Qualified candidates are warmly welcome to contact AIDA Data director <a href="mailto:joel.hedlund@liu.se">Joel Hedlund</a> or AIDA Director <a href="mailto:claes.lundstrom@liu.se">Claes Lundström</a> to discuss ways forward.</p>
